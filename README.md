## Sophisticated Syntax theme

I created this Atom.io theme to go with my [Sophisticated UI](https://github.com/JasonAMartin/sophisticated-ui) theme, but it can be used on its own. AS this was my first syntax theme for Atom.io, I started with a clone of [Atom One Dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax).

This theme is just starting out, so I expect many more changes as I use it at work for JS/React/etc development.

#### Installation

In Atom:
Settings > Install > Themes > Search for 'Sophisticated'

Via terminal:
```
apm install sophisticated-syntax
```

### Example

Here's a screen of this theme in action for 0.1.0. The UI theme is [Sophisticated UI](https://github.com/JasonAMartin/sophisticated-ui).
